        <p>
            <p>A career change isn’t just a decision, it’s a leap of faith. </p>

            <p>For Joseph, it was a gateway to pursue what he’s truly passionate about and a community who shares that drive. Joseph began his post-secondary education at BCIT where he completed a two-year architecture diploma. </p>
            
            <span id="dots">...</span>
            
            <span id="more">
                <p>His day-to-day life didn't involve much interaction with others, and it wasn’t long before COVID transferred the end of his education to the screen. Soon, Joseph began working in industry amidst the pandemic. </p>

                <p>As an AutoCAD designer and drafter at a glass company, Joseph spent his days translating clients’ requests for different glass pieces into ready-for-fabrication drafts. Joseph enjoyed the autonomy of the job and eventually became a one-man department. What he didn’t like about the job, and architecture in general, was that he wasn’t going anywhere.</p>

                <p>Three months into the job, just after his probationary period had ended, Joseph drove into work at 7:50, clocked in for the day, sat down, and had a stark realization: </p>

                <p>“I could be here for the next twenty years of my life.” </p>

                <p>He didn’t like that thought. At this point, Joseph knew that architecture wasn’t something he was particularly good at or enjoyed. It was time for a change.</p>

                <p>Unbeknownst to his employers, Joseph began completing his tasks as early as possible to spend the rest of his shifts hunting for alternative careers. Amidst a sea of personality tests and Google searches he stumbled upon a Reddit post describing something called UX design. And so started a three month period where Joseph would roll into work, complete his assignments, and research UX design. </p>

                <p>While Joseph considered completing a UX design boot camp, there was something else he was still after: a community, a chance to meet people, a new experience. </p>

                <p>Joseph applied to SIAT, a leap of faith away from his steady architecture career. While SIAT cemented Joseph’s intention to become a UX designer, he most cherishes the people he has met and experiences he’s had through the program. Getting involved with clubs, joining the student union, and building a community of like-minded people are something he feels he couldn’t have gotten elsewhere. </p>

                <p>Joseph’s advice for anyone considering a career change? “Just do it.”</p>
