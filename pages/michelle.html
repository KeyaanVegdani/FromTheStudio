        <h4>Learn About <div class="serif-italic">Michelle</div></h4>
        <p>
            <p>Surrounded by individuals just like herself, Michelle saw an opportunity to bring students together. They were, after all, struggling through the same classes. On a weekly basis, she organized group study sessions where students could support one another through assignments and exam preparation. Michelle continually made a point of encouraging first-time study session goers to participate. And it was a hit! The study sessions became increasingly popular, students flooding rooms only meant for eight people. </p>

            <p>Making an effort makes a difference. Michelle quickly learned how easy it was to connect students despite the discomfort of talking to new people. She noticed the first year students growing closer and realized that community grows outside of the comfort zone. Seeing the difference her study sessions made, Michelle was eager to connect more and more people. 
            </p>

            <p>Michelle saw the SIAT community as one she wanted to lead and was soon voted as IATONE Representative, working to bring together students through shared interests and passions. Through this role she is a voice for first year students just like herself. Michelle is currently organizing FROSH, an annual event welcoming incoming students - a full circle moment as she recalls attending FROSH herself as a brand new student. </p>

            <p>This isn’t the last we’ll be seeing of Michelle. She is excited to move onto new roles, as she intends to apply to be an events coordinator within the IAT Student Union. New people, new connections, and creating a culture of inclusivity are at the forefront of Michelle’s mind. Michelle is hungry to continue connecting more IAT students than ever, transforming SIAT into a place where everyone can truly find their people. </p>
